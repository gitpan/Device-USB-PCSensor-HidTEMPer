Device-USB-PCSensor-HidTEMPer version 0.01
==========================================

This module contains an interface to the PCSensor HidTEMPer and PCSensor 
HidTEMPerNTC temperature sensors. There are also the common functions for the
device itself (Device) and the sensors (Sensor) laying the grounds for other 
HidTEMPer versions to be added later on. 

The current temperature can be returned either using the Celsius 
scale or the Fahrenheit scale.

WARNING 

The results returned from this code needs to undergo more testing. If the
code used to write to the device is not used with extreme care it may 
destroy the device.

TODO

This release does not contain any test-scripts, this will be added in the 
next release.
